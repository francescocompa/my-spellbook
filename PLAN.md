## Shipped phases — bodies archived, models still binding

The **model** for each phase lives in `DECISIONS.md` and still constrains any change to
these surfaces; cite the D-entry, don't restate it. The task bodies (done-when evidence,
merge notes) are archived.

| Phase | What it built | Model | Bodies |
|---|---|---|---|
| **E** | a build at every level | D115(a–j) | `ARCHIVE.md#phase-e` |
| **F** | the guided builder | D118(a–k) | `ARCHIVE.md#phase-f` |
| **G** | the guide as a full-size page | D126(a–i) | `ARCHIVE.md#phase-g` |
| **H** | guided builder v2 | D130(a–h) | `ARCHIVE.md#phase-h` |
| **I** | guided builder v3 | D131(a–h) + D132 | `ARCHIVE.md#phase-i` |

→ archived 2026-08-31: the W1–W5 wave batch — `ARCHIVE.md#wave-batch`; the 2026-08-31 bug's
task lines — `ARCHIVE.md#bug-0831`; closed one-off bugs and batches (v1.3.0 → v1.4.3,
D135–D138 + the third-caster clock) — `ARCHIVE.md#closed-oneoffs-0831`.

Optional follow-up, never scoped: D76's Magical Secrets narrowing could report the EXACT
window for ordered picks instead of best-case.

## Open ⚑ — calls for Francesco

- [ ] **The `…`-placeholder family needs one call** (H6, left as scoped): "+ add a class…",
  "cantrip leaving…", "its replacement…", "filter books…", "note — e.g. …" — plus the
  same-shaped "no filter" options the audit had missed, `all schools` / `all classes`
  (index.html:139-140), `"any save"` / `"any damage"` (app.js:6383-6384) and `#fChosen`'s
  `picked` (index.html:135). They are internally consistent; one call settles all of them.
  ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-30)
- [ ] **`.gcstep.optional .gcl::after{content:" · optional"}`** (styles.css:1822) is the
  CSS-authored twin of the `"Optional"` capitalised at app.js:2042. Different surface
  (chain rail, appended mid-line after a middot) and H6's audit said no CSS work — but if
  the two should match, that is the line. ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-30)
- [ ] **`favKey` is per PRINTING, so a mark is stored under one edition** (I4): a mark lives
  under `Find Familiar|XPHB`; if `grantRec` later resolves the other printing (reprint
  filter `all`, or a book toggled) the mark is not seen. Deterministic under the default
  filter — every surface goes through `grantRec` — but making `sbFav` edition-tolerant is a
  storage-shape change. ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-30)
- [ ] **The guide's ability-score note has no home** (v1.4.5): removing the `?` before
  "Character view" (D141(b)) deleted its disclosure, and *"Ability scores aren't tracked, so
  ASI = skip the step"* is the one line in it with no remaining surface. Re-home it (the ASI
  step card is the natural place) or drop it. ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-31)

## Queue — open work

- [ ] **`refreshAddFeat()` has the identical defect for `#epicRow`** (found 2026-08-30 —
  HIGH CONFIDENCE from reading, NOT reproduced): it toggles `#epicRow` on
  `featBudget().epic`, which per D114 is a function of `featSlotLevels()` →
  `classLevelPlan()` → class levels, yet it runs only inside `refreshAll()`. So stepping a
  class across the level where an Epic Boon slot arrives should leave the row showing the
  previous answer. Verify from a fresh load, then fix. The other three `refreshAll()`
  members are clean (`refreshSpecies`, `renderCustomSources`, `renderFeatChips` read
  `state.*`, not class levels). *(Sibling defects fixed v1.2.29 and v1.4.2.)*
- [ ] **2024 pooling rounds half-casters up per class, and the app floors them** (found
  during the v1.4.3 fix, out of its scope): `compute()`/`planSlots()` lump `artificer` and
  `"1/2"` into one bucket and take `⌊half/2⌋`, but TCE Artificer and XPHB Paladin/Ranger
  round up PER CLASS when multiclassing — Artificer 5 / Wizard 5 should pool to caster
  level 8, the app says 7. Touches the pooled slot table only. ⚑ (owner: Francesco,
  2026-08-31)
- [ ] **Magic-item / reward ingestion** — 🔶 **RESEARCHED 2026-08-27, awaiting the call.**
  The old note said "items carry no structured uses"; that is **wrong** and the audit
  corrected it.
  - **Items.** `charges` (282), `recharge` (286, closed enum), `rechargeAmount` (254) and
    `attachedSpells.charges` (a real cost→spells map, 138 items) map **straight** onto the
    D55/D95 model. Staff of Fire's record is literally `pool:10 · "1d6+4 at dawn" · costs 1/3/4`.
  - **The hole:** save DC, attack bonus and casting ability are **prose only** — of 402
    items with attached spells, **zero** carry a structured DC or attack and only **9** name
    an ability. Those three fields would always arrive blank and be typed by hand.
  - **The trap:** *Luck Blade is not a record in `items.json`.* It is a magicvariant template
    (`requires:{sword:true}`) cross-multiplied against base items. 11 spell-granting
    templates expand to **115** items, plus 53 `_copy` records (41 with no content of their
    own). A naive flat read returns 402 and silently drops the rest — porting
    `_createSpecificVariants` is ~150 lines **into both extractors**.
  - **Size:** ~120 KB slimmed, ~780 KB with prose — and the prose is the only place the DC lives.
  - **SRD:** only ~80 of 542 spell-granting items are `srd52`, so the public build gets almost none.
  - **The cheaper half — `rewards.json`:** 277 charms / blessings / boons / piety traits,
    **88 with `additionalSpells`** — the *same* schema the extractors already parse for
    classes, species and feats. No new parsing, no variant cross-product, no prose regex;
    its `innate`/`known`/`prepared` map onto the app's three modes directly. **Caveat: zero
    SRD flags**, so it is import-only content.
  - **Suggested order** (not decided): rewards first as a small self-contained addition,
    then items as *"prefill a custom source from an item"* rather than a first-class entity,
    since the DC needs hand-entry regardless. ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-27)
- [ ] **`SHADOWED` is not source-aware** (D127 agent flag): with XPHB off, 90 reprinted
  subclasses stop being reprint-hidden but only 6 surface — `collapseEditions` still shadows
  them behind an XPHB winner whose book is off. Consulting `srcOn` there means re-running
  `buildIndexes` on every source change — a D-level behavioural call.
  ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-29)
- [ ] **`subclassFeature` `_copy` records (75, all shallow/same-file, zero `_mod`)** are
  still unresolved (D127 scoped them out): 2014 twins' FEATURE lists may read hollow even
  though grants now resolve. If feature names ever look wrong on a 2014 subclass, this is
  why — the resolver exists, it just isn't pointed at them. ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-29)
- [ ] **Prerequisites we can't check**: ability scores, proficiencies, backgrounds and
  campaigns aren't in the app's model, so those alternatives read "check …" rather than
  pass/fail. Closing this means tracking ability scores — a bigger change than it looks.
  ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-26)
- [ ] **Polymorph / Shapechange / True Polymorph as creature sets** — Francesco:
  "technically a spell with multiple stat block options, but perhaps it would require full
  monster catalogue". Correct: their filters are open-ended (any Beast of CR ≤ your level,
  any creature of CR ≤ …), which is the whole bestiary — 4,458 monsters. D78's carried set
  is 65. Out of scope until there is a reason to ship the catalogue; a CR-capped subset
  would still be hundreds. ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-27)
- [ ] **Detect a real long-rest spell swap in the extractors** — D73's Granted tab lists
  every `kind:"known"` pick because the digest has no flag for "you may replace this on a
  long rest". **Attempted 2026-08-27 and deliberately stopped:** the prose is there
  ("Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace that cantrip…") but it is NOT on the
  species entry a flat walk reaches — it lives inside 5etools' unresolved `_copy._mod` /
  `_versions` blocks and inside TABLE rows. A regex over `entries` finds **zero** matches.
  Closing this means resolving those structures, which neither extractor does. Bigger than
  it looks. ⚑ (owner: Francesco, 2026-08-27)
- [ ] High Elf true in-table cantrip swap; Human extra-origin restricted to origin cats.
